## Overview

Digital-Body-Language is a demo web application created during **HackBees**. It captures micro-interaction signals (typing, pauses, backspaces, scrolls, clicks) from users, processes them via a small machine learning model, and infers metrics like user engagement or compatibility in real-time.

The objective is to show how subtle digital interaction cues can be used to estimate how engaged or compatible two users are, based on their behavior while interacting with the application.

---

## Features

- Capture user micro-interactions in real time:
  - Key typing speed  
  - Pause durations between typing  
  - Backspace / corrections  
  - Scrolling behavior  
  - Click patterns  

- Machine Learning (ML) inference to estimate:
  - Engagement  
  - Compatibility / bonding  

- Frontend UI to display inferred metrics live.

- Backend services for collecting, pre-processing, and evaluating data.

- Testing suite to validate correctness.

- Containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

---

## Architecture

Here is a high-level overview of how components interact:

```

\[Frontend] <--> \[Backend API] <--> \[ML Service]
\                     /
\--- Logging, storage/

````

- **Frontend**: Collects the user interaction events, sends to backend.  
- **Backend API**: Receives interaction data, does lightweight pre-processing, orchestrates sending to ML service, returns results.  
- **ML Service**: Hosts the model, performs inference, returns engagement/compatibility scores.  
- **Tests**: Validate both frontend & backend behaviors.  
- **Docker / Docker Compose**: Bring up all services together.

## Tech Stack

| Component        | Tech / Frameworks                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | Javascript / React (or other UI lib)   |
| Backend          | Flask / Django / FastAPI / etc.        |
| ML Service       | Python, scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on model) |
| Database / Storage | (If used) e.g. SQLite / PostgreSQL / NoSQL |
| Containerization | Docker, docker-compose                |
| Testing          | pytest / unittest / Jest (depending on component) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Docker  
- Docker-Compose  
- (Optional) Python 3.7 or later if running non-docker version  
- (Optional) Node.js / npm / yarn if frontend needs build  

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnuragRaut08/Digital-body-language.git
   cd Digital-body-language
````

2. (Optional) If using virtual environments for development:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Locally

Using Docker Compose (recommended):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This should build and start all services (frontend, backend, ML service). Access the frontend via `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port is configured) and APIs via `http://localhost:<backend_port>`.

Without Docker:

* Start ML service: navigate to `ml_service/`, install its dependencies, run the service.
* Start Backend: similarly, install backend requirements, configure environment variables, run.
* Start Frontend: install dependencies, run dev server.

---

## Usage

Once everything is up:

1. Navigate to frontend in browser.
2. Interact (type, scroll, click, pause) in provided input fields.
3. The frontend sends interaction events to backend.
4. Backend preprocesses and forwards to ML service.
5. ML service returns predicted engagement/compatibility metrics.
6. Frontend displays these in real time.

You may tweak thresholds, model parameters, etc. depending on how aggressive or sensitive you want the inference to be.

---

## Model / Machine Learning Service

* The ML model is trained on data of user micro-interactions.
* Pre-processing includes normalization of event intervals, handling of missing events, smoothing of noisy signals.
* The service exposes an API endpoint (e.g. `/predict`) which accepts JSON-formatted interaction data and returns prediction scores.
* (Optional) Training scripts / datasets may be included or you can replace with your own.

---

## Testing

* There are test suites under `tests/` folder.

* Run backend + ML tests with:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

* (If frontend has tests) run using:

  ```bash
  npm test
  # or
  yarn test
  ```

Make sure code passes tests before merging or deploying.

---

## Docker & Deployment

* The `docker-compose.yml` file defines services: frontend, backend, ml\_service, etc.

* To build images and run:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

* To stop:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

* For production deployment, you may want to:

  * Use environment variables for secrets, ports, etc.
  * Use a production-grade server (e.g. Gunicorn / Uvicorn for backend, serve frontend build statically).
  * SSL / HTTPS, monitoring, logging, scaling considerations.

## Configuration

Here are common configuration / environment variables you may need to set:

| Variable          | Description                  | Default / Example      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `BACKEND_PORT`    | Port on which backend runs   | `8000`                 |
| `ML_SERVICE_PORT` | Port for ML service          | `5000`                 |
| `FRONTEND_PORT`   | Port for frontend dev server | `3000`                 |
| `ML_MODEL_PATH`   | Path to trained model file   | `ml_service/model.pkl` |
| `LOG_LEVEL`       | Logging verbosity            | `INFO`, `DEBUG` etc.   |

Specify these via `.env` files or Docker compose environment setup.
